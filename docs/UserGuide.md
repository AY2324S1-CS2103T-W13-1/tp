## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands acting on the address book must contain the `-pa` (for patient) and the `-sp` (for specialist) tag to specify which subset they 
would like the command to operate on.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -pa n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add -pa n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [m/MEDICAL_HISTORY]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/Osteoporosis` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MEDICAL_HISTORY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/Osteoporosis`, `m/Osteoporosis m/Asthma` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
